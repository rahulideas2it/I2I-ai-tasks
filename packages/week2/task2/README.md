# ðŸ’³ Strategy Pattern: Money Withdrawal

> A TypeScript implementation demonstrating the **Strategy Design Pattern** to handle money withdrawals across different account types.

## ðŸ§  Concept
The Strategy Pattern allows the definition of a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern is used here to switch between different account withdrawal strategies (Savings, Checking, Crypto).

## ðŸ”§ Pattern Used
**Strategy Pattern** â€” Helps decouple the algorithm from the context and allows runtime substitution.

## ðŸ’¼ Use Case
Simulates a banking app where users can withdraw from different types of accounts:
- **Savings** with strict withdrawal limits
- **Checking** with overdraft allowance
- **Crypto** with fee calculation

## ðŸ§© File Structure
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ account.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ withdrawal-strategy.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ strategies.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts
tests/
â””â”€â”€ strategy.test.ts
```

## ðŸ“¦ Setup

```bash
npm install
```

## ðŸš€ Run the App

```bash
npx ts-node src/index.ts
```

## ðŸ§ª Run Tests

```bash
npx jest
```

## âœ… Features
- Strategy abstraction
- Three concrete withdrawal strategies
- Fully testable design
- Follows SOLID principles
- Unit tested using Jest
